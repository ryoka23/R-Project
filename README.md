# R-Project - Spotify Streams Data Analysis
## Introduction
My name is Ryan Oka and this is my R and Shiny Project for the NYC Data Science Academy Bootcamp. I utilized R Studio to analyze and visualize my data using various libraries such as caret, dplyr, ggplot2, graphics, tidyr and shiny to build my visualizations.
## Overview
The dataset came from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnavvvvv/spotify-music/data) and contained data on Spotiy songs released 1930-2023. Within the dataset was each song's metrics related to streams, number of playlist/chart apperances across different streaming platforms, and measures/scores on audio features.

The goal of my project was to analyze and create an interactive visualization of trends across songs in time and features. My approach was to analyze the number of streams by song and the relationship they had with the various metrics for correlations to predict stream counts.
This included:
* Playlist and chart metrics
* Measures/scores of audio features
* Training a linear model based off the p-value and correlation metrics

## Project
This project allowed me to learn and practice my R skills in segmenting the data, parsing out and filtering the data to visualize, and statistical/linear model training techniques. 
I was also able to utilize the Shiny application to create an interactive visualization of my analysis for the user to explore on their own interests. As an avid music listener, this allowed me to pursue my passions for music and gain a better understaning of what data lies behind music streaming.
